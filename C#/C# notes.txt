-> C# is object oriented programming language provided by microsoft that runs on .Net framework
-> with the help of c#, we can develop diff types of secured and robust app:
    -> window applications
    -> web applications
    -> distributed applications
    -> web service applications
    -> database applications
-> C# is designed for CLI(Common language Infrastructre). CLI is a specification that describes executable code and runtime environment.

-> C# FEATURES:
    - simple
    - modern programming language
    - object oriented
    - type safe
    - interoperability
    - scalable and updateable
    - component oriented
    - structured programming language
    - rich library
    - fast speed

-> C# VARIABLES:(int, double, float, char)
    - Decimal types
    - Boolean types
    - Integral types
    - Floating point types
    - Nullable types

-> DATA TYPES:
    - there are 3 types of data types:
        * Value Data type
        * Pointer Data type
        * References Data type
    
    - Value Data type:
        => these are integer-based and floating-based. 
        => C# supports both signed and unsigned literals
        => there are 2 types:
            1. Pre defined(Integer, Boolean, Float, etc)
            2. User defined(Structure, Enumerations etc)
    
    - References Data type:
        => they do not contain the actual data stored in a variable, but they contain a ref to the variables
        => if the data is changed by one of the variable, the other variable automatically reflects this change in Value
        => there are 2 types:
            1. Pre defined(objects, String)
            2. User defined(Class, Interface)
        
    - Pointer Data type:
        => it is a variable, it is also known as locator or indicator that points to an address of a value
        => & (address operator) (determine the address of the variable)
        => * (indirection operator) (access the value of an address)

-> OPERATORS:
    - arithmetic(+, -, *, /, %)
    - relational(<, <=, >, >=, ==, !=)
    - logical(&&, ||, !)
    - bitwise(&, |, <<, >>, ~, ^)
    - assignment(=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
    - unary(++, --)
    - ternary(? :)
    - Misc

-> KEYWORDS:
    - A keyword is a reserved word. You cannot use it as a variable name, constant name etc.
    - In C# keywords cannot be used as identifiers. However, if we want to use the keywords as identifiers, we may prefix the keyword with @ character.
